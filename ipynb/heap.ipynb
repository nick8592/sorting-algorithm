    "# Heap Sort: Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It leverages the properties of a binary heap to sort an array efficiently. Heap sort first converts the input array into a **max heap** (a binary tree where the root node is always greater than its children). Then, it repeatedly swaps the root (the largest element) with the last element of the array, reduces the heap size, and heapifies the root to maintain the heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- Best Case: O(n log n)\n",
    "- Worst Case: O(n log n)\n",
    "- Average Case: O(n log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- O(1) (in-place sorting)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps of the Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Build a max heap** from the input array.\n",
    "   - Start from the last non-leaf node and heapify each node upwards.\n",
    "2. **Heapify the root** element to maintain the max heap property.\n",
    "   - Swap the root (largest value) with the last element of the heap.\n",
    "3. Reduce the heap size by one.\n",
    "4. **Repeat heapify** for the root to rebuild the heap and maintain the max heap property.\n",
    "5. Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the array `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build max heap: `[13, 12, 7, 5, 6, 11]`\n",
    "2. Swap root (13) with last element (11): `[11, 12, 7, 5, 6, 13]`\n",
    "3. Heapify the reduced heap: `[12, 11, 7, 5, 6, 13]`\n",
    "4. Swap root (12) with second last element (6): `[6, 11, 7, 5, 12, 13]`\n",
    "5. Heapify the reduced heap: `[11, 6, 7, 5, 12, 13]`\n",
    "6. Continue this process until the array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output result array `[5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]`"
